# 🤖 *Intelligence* in Artificial Intelligence 🧠

I am fascinated by the intersection of artificial intelligence and human intelligence. I want to know how intelligence works through the lenses of deep learning:

>**Geometries of learned representation spaces in deep learning, esp. LLMs and VLMs**

>**Generative models as the approximation of reality**

>**World models in language models and model-based reinforcement learning**
