# 🤖 *Intelligence* in Artificial Intelligence 🧠

I am fascinated by the intersection of **artificial** and **natural intelligence**. My research seeks to understand the intrinsic mechanisms of intelligence through the lens of deep learning, with a specific focus on:

> **Geometries of learned representations** in deep networks
>
> **World models** in reinforcement learning and large language models
