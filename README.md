# 🤖 Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence 🧠

I am fascinated by the intersection of artificial intelligence and human intelligence. I want to uncover various mysteries of human consciousness through the lenses of machine learning:

`How is spatio-temporal cognition acquired in artificial intelligence?`

`How do machine "minds" evolve through genetic dynamics and individual learning?`

`Can generative algorithms illuminate how humans approximate reality through intersubjective perspectives?`

### 📚 Research Topics

I focus on the following areas to explore these questions:

- **Model-Based Reinforcement Learning**
- **Language Models**

### 🚀 Projects

#### [FARCER](https://github.com/hironcode/farcer.git)  
A **Multimodal LLM (VLM) architecture** pushing the boundaries of emotion recognition:  
- 🖼️ Integrates lightweight linear layers as a vision encoder.  
- 🧠 Harnesses the reasoning prowess of chat-tuned LLMs, even with frozen core models.  
- 🌌 Bridges the gap between **language models** and **visual understanding**.

#### [Probing Spatiotemporal Representation in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/hironcode/world-language-grounding.git)  
- 🔍 Conducted **linear and non-linear probing** to decode spatiotemporal representations of model-based reinforcement learning models.
- 🤖 Investigated pretrained `DreamerV3` to uncover representations in the dynamics model (RSSM).

#### [Multi-Agent Simulation of Evolutionary Psychology (WIP)](https://github.com/hironcode/evolutionary_language_model.git)  
- 🌍 Simulates **cultural evolution** using small LMs and genetic algorithms.  
- 🧬 Explores **multi-agent interactions** inspired by evolutionary psychology.
